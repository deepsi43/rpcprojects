# rpcprojects
The concepts  of rpc servr usage on a blockchain/cryptographic network by the client in the network infrastructure and sending back 
notifications using notification handlers along with the concepts of golang using encoding json format with encoding/json-rpc commands
and usage of mutex package for client purposes and configuring the connections for the rpc server in order to be used by the network 
for both the daemon of the blockchain and the wallet configurations.To check with the connect and disconnect and connection issues of
client with the rpc server(the remote procedure call usage by he network for both the main and testnet)
#Terms of usage:
Can be run only with the main package
Cannot be run by non-mainpackages with out a test file for the code being written
need to create a test file and use the commands "go test" in order to check the conditions of the code being valid
Clone the repository to a local folder
And then use the go get command for the required git imports
use the example file in order to run by configuring the rpc connection properties username and password
Use the "go run" command in order to run the file
#Steps to change the code to be executable
Use the "go run"
Use the go install command to check for the go file in package which 
will automatically create a go executable to be used.
